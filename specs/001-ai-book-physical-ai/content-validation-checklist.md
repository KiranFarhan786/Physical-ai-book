- [ ] Unnecessary jargon is avoided
- [ ] Language is appropriate for target audience
- [ ] Concepts build progressively in complexity
- [ ] Each lesson has practical relevance
- [ ] Content aligns with Physical AI and humanoid robotics focus

## Structure and Consistency Validation

- [ ] Lesson follows the required structure: Concept → Tools → Workflow → Relevance → Outcomes
- [ ] All required sections are present and complete
- [ ] Terminology is consistent with other lessons in the module
- [ ] Learning outcomes are specific, measurable, and achievable
- [ ] Architecture diagrams follow the established templates
- [ ] All images and diagrams are clear and relevant
- [ ] Cross-references to other lessons are accurate

## Completeness Validation

- [ ] Connections to broader robotics concepts are made clear
- [ ] Summary adequately covers key points
- [ ] Next steps are clearly outlined

## Review Process

1. Author completes initial draft
2. Technical expert reviews for accuracy (use technical accuracy section)
3. Educational expert reviews for clarity and pedagogy (use educational quality section)
4. Editor reviews for structure and consistency (use structure and consistency section)
5. Final review combining all validation aspects (use all sections)
