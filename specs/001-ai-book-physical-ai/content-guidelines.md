# Content Guidelines for AI-Native Technical Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Lesson Structure Template

Each lesson in the book must follow this consistent structure:

### 1. Title
- Clear, descriptive title that indicates the main concept
- Format: "[Main Concept]: [Specific Focus]"

### 2. Concept Explanation
- Clear explanation of the core concept
- Use simple, accessible language
- Define all acronyms on first use
- Provide context for why this concept matters in robotics

### 3. Tools & Technologies Overview
- List and describe the key tools covered in the lesson
- Explain how these tools are used in the context of the concept
- Include version numbers where relevant
- Link to official documentation

### 4. Architecture & Workflow
- Describe the system architecture or workflow
- Use text-based diagrams where needed
- Explain how components interact
- Include practical examples

### 5. Real-World Relevance
- Explain how this concept applies in real robotics systems
- Provide practical examples
- Connect to the broader field of Physical AI

### 6. Learning Outcomes
- List 2-4 specific, measurable outcomes
- Use action verbs (explain, implement, describe, identify, etc.)
- Focus on practical understanding

## Writing Guidelines

### Language
- Use clear, simple English
- Avoid jargon unless necessary; explain when used
- Define technical terms when first introduced
- Write for undergraduate-level understanding

### Technical Accuracy
- Verify all commands and configurations work in real environments
- Include version numbers for tools and libraries
- Reference official documentation
- Test all simulation workflows

### Consistency
- Use consistent terminology across all modules
- Follow the same structure for all lessons
- Include visual architecture diagrams (described in text)
- Provide real-world examples and applications

## Content Quality Standards

### Accuracy
- All technical explanations must be correct and industry-aligned
- Every concept, tool, and workflow must reflect real-world implementations
- Content must align with current best practices in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

### Clarity
- Concepts explained step-by-step with simple language
- Content accessible to undergraduate-level learners
- All acronyms explained on first use
- Unnecessary jargon avoided

### Practical Orientation
- Focus on real tools (ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, Unity) rather than theoretical concepts
- Emphasize hands-on learning with actual tools
- All commands, configs, and workflows must represent realistic implementations

## Markdown Formatting Standards

### Headers
- Use proper heading hierarchy (##, ###, ####)
- Only one H1 per document (the title)

### Code Blocks
- Use appropriate language identifiers
- Example:
  ```markdown
  ```python
  # Python code example
  import rospy
  ```
  ```

### Lists
- Use consistent bullet points and numbering
- Maintain proper indentation

### Links
- Use descriptive link text
- Format: [descriptive text](url)
